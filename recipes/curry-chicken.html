<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing more comforting than chicken and potatoes, 
        and this recipe is no exception. Getting its flavor and heat 
        from a combination of mild Jamaican curry powder and Scotch 
        bonnet pepper, it’s not as hot as some Indian or Thai curries.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 - 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken cut ups ((I prefer thighs bone in chopped in half for more flavour but any cut is good)</li>
        <br>
        <li>2-4 tbsp of curry</li>
        <br>    
        <li>1/2 cup of green seasoning fresh or bottled ( plus extra fresh if you want to add in more while curry is stewing)</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Salt and pepper to preference</li>
        <br>    
        <li>3-4 cloves of garlic chopped in half</li>
        <br>    
        <li>1/4 cup of olive or coconut oil</li>
        <br>    
        <li>1 - 1 1/2 cups of water or broth plus 1-2 tbsp of water</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean chicken and season with green seasoning and salt and pepper and optionally a tbsp of curry powder(not necessary but add to the flavour). Marinade for at least an hour to over night.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a small bowl make a runny paste with remaining curry and water and set aside</li>
        <br>    
        <li>In a medium sauce pan heat up oil to medium and add the garlic pieces and let them gently sauté until they turn a dark brown and then remove the cloves and discard (goal here is to flavour the oil)</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Pour in curry paste and scald (stir around hot surface of pot) for a minute or so</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Put in meat and stir and sauté for a minute or two and then add water to about halfway cover the meat, more can be added later if you like a lot of gravy.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Stew for about 20-30 minutes</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Cook off some of the liquid by stewing longer with lid off if you like a thicker curry.</li>
    </ol>
