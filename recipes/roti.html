<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups flour(1 kg)</li>
        <br>
        <li>8 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>4 cups water(960 mL)</li>
        <br>
        <li>¾ cup ghee(170 g), clarified butter or butter of choice (oil, for frying)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until fully incorporated.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Slowly add the water until the mixture forms a dough.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Divide the dough into roughly 12 loyas (balls), cover with a dish towel, and let rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Sprinkle each ball with flour and flatten or roll out into a circle roughly 5 inches (12-cm) in diameter.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Spread ghee on each round and make a cut from the center out to the edge, then roll to make a cone.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Press the peak and flatten the center of the cone. Let rest for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>On a floured surface, roll each ball into a circle roughly 8 inches (20-cm) in diameter.</li>
        <br>    
        <li>Heat a tawah or flat frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat with oil and place a round of dough on the pan.</li>
        <br>   
        <li>Cook the dough until light brown, watching carefully, about 5 minutes. Then flip and cook on the other side, about 3-4 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds.</li>
        <br>  
        <li>Break up the cooked roti with your hands or serve whole.</li>
